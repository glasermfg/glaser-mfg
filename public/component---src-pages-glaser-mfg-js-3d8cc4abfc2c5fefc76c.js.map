Heat, found in the feed water system, is\r\n                    a driving force for corrosion. The ability for oxygen to\r\n                    attack forming a pit on metal, increases by a factor of two\r\n                    for every 10ºC (18ºF) rise in temperature. Oxygen can be 512\r\n                    times as aggressive at 212º than it was at 50ºF. Mechanical\r\n                    deaeration, can remove most, but not all of the oxygen from\r\n                    the water. An oxygen scavenger is used to eliminate the\r\n                    remaining oxygen. Properly applied, oxygen scavengers will\r\n                    prevent oxygen pitting and extend the life of your boiler.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Every boiler setup is a little different based on feed\r\n                    water, size, operating parameters and boiler usage.
