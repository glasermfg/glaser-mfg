In nature, the sun\r\n                    produces UV rays, which have a germicidal effect on disease\r\n                    causing pathogens in water. When these contaminants are\r\n                    exposed to UV light, they are rendered harmless, and the\r\n                    output water is considered disinfected for human\r\n                    consumption. UV technology is proven to control\r\n                    microbiological (bacteria & virus) issues in water including\r\n                    E. coli, Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia. The UV\r\n                    purifier doesn't add or remove anything from the water and\r\n                    is extremely cost effective. UV purification affects\r\n                    waterborne contaminants and disease-causing pathogens with a\r\n                    99.9% kill rate or better. The result is high quality water\r\n                    that is clean, clear, pure, and safe drinking water for your\r\n                    family.
