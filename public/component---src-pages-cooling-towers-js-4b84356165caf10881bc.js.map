Water is\r\n                    constantly circulated through the system, and, when it\r\n                    enters the cooling tower heated due to industrial processes,\r\n                    it is exposed to the air, resulting in evaporation. This\r\n                    reduces the temperature of the water enough that it can be\r\n                    recirculated and used for cooling. This cycle of evaporation\r\n                    requires the supply of water to be continuously replenished.\r\n                    However, the water that is fed into the cooling system is\r\n                    typically rife with contaminants, which can cause scale and\r\n                    corrosion. The chemicals that water treatment companies use\r\n                    are designed to address and prevent these issues. The cost\r\n                    of your water management program represents approximately\r\n                    2–4% of the overall operating costs to run your steam\r\n                    system. Just 1/8” of scale can increase fuel consumption by\r\n                    12%. That’s why it’s important to invest in a well-executed\r\n                    program that delivers results over the asset life cycle.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    The right combination of chemicals to use in your facility\r\n                    depends on a range of factors, including what type of\r\n                    cooling tower you have and the quality of the water being\r\n                    fed into the system. Typically water treatment for cooling\r\n                    towers involves the use of:\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Scale and corrosion inhibitor – This chemical is designed to\r\n                    control the build up of scale in the cooling towers using\r\n                    all-organic corrosion inhibitors.
