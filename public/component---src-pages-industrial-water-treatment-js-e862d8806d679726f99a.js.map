The cost of your water management program\r\n                    typically represents approximately 2–4% of the overall\r\n                    operating costs to run your steam system. Just 1/16” of\r\n                    scale can increase fuel consumption by 12%. That’s why it’s\r\n                    important to invest in a well-executed program that delivers\r\n                    results over the asset life cycle. Our Boiler Treatment\r\n                    programs are tailored to prevent corrosion, prevent scale\r\n                    build up and protect your return line.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <h2>Corrosion Inhibitors</h2>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    The addition of oxygen to a system with water and heat will\r\n                    initiate corrosion. Heat, found in the feed water system, is\r\n                    a driving force for corrosion. The ability for oxygen to\r\n                    attack forming a pit on metal, increases by a factor of two\r\n                    for every 10ºC (18ºF) rise in temperature. Oxygen can be 512\r\n                    times as aggressive at 212º than it was at 50ºF. Mechanical\r\n                    deaeration can remove most, but not all of the oxygen from\r\n                    the water. An oxygen scavenger is used to eliminate the\r\n                    remaining oxygen. Properly applied, oxygen scavengers will\r\n                    prevent oxygen pitting and extend the life of your boiler.\r\n                    Every boiler setup is a little different based on feed\r\n                    water, size, operating parameters and boiler usage. We offer\r\n                    several different corrosion inhibitors to provide the\r\n                    optimal coverage of your boiler based on your situation.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <h2>Scale Inhibitors</h2>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Boiler scale is caused by impurities being precipitated out\r\n                    of the water directly on heat transfer surfaces or by\r\n                    suspended matter in water settling out on the metal and\r\n                    becoming hard and adherent. Evaporation in a boiler causes\r\n                    impurities to concentrate. This interferes with heat\r\n                    transfers and may cause hot spots, leading to local\r\n                    overheating. Common feed water contaminants that can form\r\n                    boiler deposits include calcium, magnesium, iron, aluminum,\r\n                    and silica. Scale is formed by salts that have limited\r\n                    solubility but are not totally insoluble in boiler water.\r\n                    These salts reach the deposit site in a soluble form and\r\n                    precipitate onto the tubes of the boiler. Even a small\r\n                    increase in scale can drastically increase the operating\r\n                    costs of a boiler as you can see from the chart below. Scale\r\n                    can also produce damage to the boiler if hot spots occur,\r\n                    cause unscheduled downtime and increase cleaning expense.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <img\r\n                    className=\"img-fluid\"\r\n                    src={scaleImg}\r\n                    alt=\"Scale Inhibitors\"\r\n                  />\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Our Chemical Treatment Program takes into account the feed\r\n                    water quality, internal treatment products to the boiler\r\n                    feedwater quality to prevent scale and excessive sludge\r\n                    accumulation.

This corrosion can\r\n                    cause unexpected system shutdowns, affecting production\r\n                    timelines and costly repairs. Corroded systems are also less\r\n                    efficient, risking leaks and potentially causing damage to\r\n                    the boiler as corrosion by products are carried back into\r\n                    the feedwater. The condensate return line treatments react\r\n                    quickly to neutralize condensed steam carbonic acid with\r\n                    amines to neutralize the return line and buffer the pH level\r\n                    to prevent corrosion. There are many types of condensate\r\n                    treatments, but the most common are amines. We carry several\r\n                    different return line treatments to offer full protection no\r\n                    matter whether it is a short, medium or long return line\r\n                    system.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <h2>Closed Loop System Heating and Cooling</h2>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Corrosion will occur naturally in closed Loop systems and\r\n                    the consequences when systems fail is both disruptive and\r\n                    cost. It is important to understand the causes and impact of\r\n                    corrosion of different system metals. In a closed-loop\r\n                    system, oxygen pitting is the most common type of corrosion.\r\n                    Symptoms of oxygen pitting may be rusty water, pitting in\r\n                    pipes or recurring maintenance on bearings and seals due to\r\n                    the abrasion caused by the corrosion products against the\r\n                    seal surfaces. Glaser offers several different types of\r\n                    corrosion inhibitors from traditional products such as Moly\r\n                    and Nitrite to new generation environmentally friendly\r\n                    corrosion inhibitors. Each system is different and we\r\n                    provide a recommendation based on your needs to provide the\r\n                    optimal corrosion coverage. Once a corrosion inhibitor has\r\n                    been added to a system the job is not done either. Regular\r\n                    testing is recommended to ensure inhibitor levels are\r\n                    maintained and your system is being protected.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <h2>Cooling Towers</h2>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Cooling towers work by using heat exchange. Water is\r\n                    constantly circulated through the system, and, when it\r\n                    enters the cooling tower heated due to industrial processes,\r\n                    it is exposed to the air, resulting in evaporation. This\r\n                    reduces the temperature of the water enough that it can be\r\n                    recirculated and used for cooling. This cycle of evaporation\r\n                    requires the supply of water to be continuously replenished.\r\n                    However, the water that is fed into the cooling system is\r\n                    typically rife with contaminants, which can cause scale and\r\n                    corrosion. The chemicals that water treatment companies use\r\n                    are designed to address and prevent these issues. The cost\r\n                    of your water management program represents approximately\r\n                    2–4% of the overall operating costs to run your steam\r\n                    system. Just 1/8” of scale can increase fuel consumption by\r\n                    12%. That’s why it’s important to invest in a well-executed\r\n                    program that delivers results over the asset life cycle. The\r\n                    right combination of chemicals to use in your facility\r\n                    depends on a range of factors, including what type of\r\n                    cooling tower you have and the quality of the water being\r\n                    fed into the system. Typically water treatment for cooling\r\n                    towers involves the use of:\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <ul>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                      Scale and corrosion inhibitor – This chemical is designed\r\n                      to control the build up of scale in the cooling towers\r\n                      using all-organic corrosion inhibitors.
