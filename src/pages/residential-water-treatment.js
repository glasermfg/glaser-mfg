                  <p>
                    When hardness minerals are combined with heat, it forms a
                    build up of scale in your plumbing, water heater and other
                    water using appliances and fixtures. When combined with
                    soap, the minerals form soap curds or scum causing dry and
                    itchy skin, lifeless hair, and dull laundry. We have a wide
                    selection of softeners, and all of our products can be
                    customized to provide the ultimate water solution. You'll
                    enjoy fast, friendly & knowledgeable service & competitive
                    prices.

                  <h2>Reverse Osmosis Systems</h2>
                  <p>
                    Reverse Osmosis is the most popular solution for homeowners
                    who want high quality water but more convenience (no lifting
                    and storing of heavy jugs) and an economical alternative to
                    bottled water. This proven reverse-osmosis method removes
                    impurities and provides a steady supply of highly purified
                    water you can depend on right from your tap. The RO System
                    not only removes tiny particles suspended in water; it also
                    removes contaminants that are dissolved in water that
                    conventional filters cannot remove. Easily installed in any
                    home, either under the kitchen sink or in the basement
                    below; this system provides clean, great tasting water to a
                    dedicated faucet at your kitchen sink. We offer a range of
                    models from small 50 GPD system that can fit under your sink
                    to larger whole house RO Systems

                  <h2>Ultraviolet Sterilizer (UV system)</h2>
                  <p>
                    Ultraviolet water purifier technology seeks to use the same
                    process as nature to provide drinking water that is
                    completely Safe, Clean, and Fresh. In nature, the sun
                    produces UV rays, which have a germicidal effect on disease
                    causing pathogens in water. When these contaminants are
                    exposed to UV light, they are rendered harmless, and the
                    output water is considered disinfected for human
                    consumption. UV technology is proven to control
                    microbiological (bacteria & virus) issues in water including
                    E. coli, Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia. The UV
                    purifier doesn't add or remove anything from the water and
                    is extremely cost effective. UV purification affects
                    waterborne contaminants and disease-causing pathogens with a
                    99.9% kill rate or better. The result is high quality water
                    that is clean, clear, pure, and safe drinking water for your
                    family. We offer 6 to 30 GPM UV Systems with LED display
                    showing lamp life remaining and audible indicator. We also
                    offer NSF UV systems and bulbs.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      By exposing contaminated water to high-intensity UV light,
                      disease-causing microorganisms are rendered harmless.

                  <h2>Iron Filtration and Sulfur Systems</h2>
                  <p>
                    Our Iron filtration systems work by using a proprietary
                    blend of media and filtration processes to reduce
                    contaminants such as iron, sulfur, arsenic, and others. Iron
                    filtration systems can reduce the amount of iron found in
                    water throughout your home, removing buildup, protecting
                    water-using appliances, and reducing staining in your sinks,
                    tubs, and laundry.

                  <h2>Carbon Filters</h2>
                  <p>
                    Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC) is universally recognized
                    and widely used as an effective adsorbent for a wide variety
                    of organic contaminants, industrial chemicals, and
                    trihalomethanes (THMs). Carbon is extremely porous and
                    provides a large surface area for contaminants to collect,
                    such as sediment and rust. It will absorb chlorine and other
                    odors and tastes. It is widely used to treat heavily
                    chlorinated municipalities, removing harmful chlorine.
