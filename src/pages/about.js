                    In 2021 the two companies joined forces to be able to
                    combine our expertise and be able to provide a full line of
                    water treatment products and solutions from residential
                    filtration systems to chemical treatment for larger
                    industrial boilers and everything in between. With over 60
                    years combined in the water treatment business we haven't
                    seen it all yet but we are getting closer and we are
                    confident that we can help find a solution to any water
                    issue that you might be having.
